<p> {$requesting.name} has added you to the '{$roleName}' role of the 
<a href="{$wsURL}">{$wsName|inempty(No Name)|html} workspace.</p>

<p>Cognoscenti is a cloud-based service to help people manage the documents, 
topics, and action items of a workspace.  
It uses an approach known as Adaptive Case Management (ACM).  
By being added to this role, you will have some ability to access that workspace 
and to receive email from the people working on the workspace.</p>

<p>I've checked, and there is no user profile for you at this email address ({$requesing.userId}).  
Creating a new login profile is free and easy.</p>

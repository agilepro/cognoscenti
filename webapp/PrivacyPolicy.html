<h1>The Short Version</h1>

<p>Circle Weaver Tech is dedicated to providing a system for people to use to collaborate with each other more effectively.  We require a minimal amount of personal information that is necessary to do this.  We collect and process only the information you choose to give us for the goal of collaborating with other users of the service.   

Circle Weaver Tech does not own, control, or direct the client data that you share in a workspace.  Only the members of a workspace can access your client data.  We take all the standard precautions to make sure that your client data is not accessible by others who are not members of the workspace.  Because we do not control your client data, Circle Weaver Tech is not acting in the capacity of a data controller with regards to your client data.  We do not give or sell your client data to anyone.  We share it only with people you direct us to share it with as part of running a collaboration site.</p>

<p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p>

<h2>Required Information</h2>

<h3>Email Address</h3>

<p>All participants are required to provide an email address.  An email address is required to serve as a globally unique identification number, so that access control to all information can be accurately implemented.  A functioning email address is required so that you can set up and manage a password to authenticate yourself to the system.  All users are authenticated using an email address and a password.</p>

<p>This email address is never sold to others nor is it used for marketing purposes.  The email address is used only to communicated to you as required to perform the function of collaboration.  The function of a collaboration site is to inform you of actions of others, of new materials available, of changes in status of objects in the system.  As part of using Circle Weaver you will receive email messages for these purposes of informing you of updates in the system.</p>

<p>Your email address will be visible to others that are using the system.  As you update or modify things in the system, a trace of those updates is kept and other users of the system will see who it is that has done these changes.  Since your email address serves as a unique id, it is used to uniquely identify the changes that you have performed on the system.  If you never modify any object in the system, and never interact with the objects, then no trace of modifications will be available for others to see.</p>

<p><b>Because the purpose of a collaboration system is to make others aware of the changes that others make in the shared information, all users of Circle Weaver must implicitly accept that records of their actions within the system are disclosed to other people using the system.</b></p>

<p>If you wish to use Circle Weaver without your personal email address being seen by others, you are encouraged to obtain and use a email address from a free or low cost supplier, like GMail or competitor to use as a unique ID and as a way to receive communications from Circle Weaver.  If you are not able to find a suitable vendor for this, an obfuscated email address can be provided for a reasonable charge not to exceed $15/month by making a written request to Circle Weaver Tech LLC.</p>

<h3>Full Name</h3>

<p>Each user provides a full name which is used as a label for the records of the actions that you take in the system.  Your name will be disclosed to other users of the system.</p>

<p>You are allowed to enter an alias.  You can set your name to be any value that you wish, and that will be the name that others in the system will identify you as.</p>

<h3>Trace (History) Records</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, as you take actions in the system, records of the actions you take are retained in order to let others know what you have done.  For example, if you upload a document to the system, your name and id will be associated with the document so that others know who uploaded it.  If an action item is assigned to you, then other users in the system (with appropriate access rights) will be able to see the task and see that it is assigned to you.  This is the very purpose of a collaboration system.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are a technology feature of a browser that allows you to log into Circle Weaver, and for the software to reliably identify you as you access other pages.  When you log in, a cookie is supplied to the browser, and subsequent requests on your behalf will be trusted only if that cookie is returned as part of the request.  This is how authentication and access control works.</p>

<p>Cookies are also given to the browser to save the login id that you have used in the past, simply as a convenience to make it easier to log in the next time you visit.</p>

<p>You may clear your cookies at any time, but you will lose your current logged in session, and you will not be allowed access until you log in again.</p>

<h3>Icon Image</h3>

<p>A user may set an image to represent them on the site.  This image might be a personal photo of their head, or it might be anything else.  If the user uploads a personal photo of themselves as their icon, they must be aware that others using the site will be able to see that image.  If you do not wish a personal image to be seen by other users, you should use some other, non-personal image, as your icon image.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Client Data</h2>

<p>Circle Weaver is a site people use to collaborate with each other.  It is a site for sharing information.  Circle Weaver has no control of the type or nature of information that the users may wish to share.   Users can upload documents to the site, or enter information in comments or discussion topics.  Users can request that others do tasks, and they can track which tasks have been completed or not.</p>

<p>Client data entered by users into the Circle Weaver site will be shared to others in the way that the client specifies them to be shared.  This is, after all, the very purpose of a collaboration site.  Circel Weaver Tech takes reasonable precautions to assure that client data is not accessible to people that you do not specify to chare with.</p>

<p><b>Users should never upload or enter highly personal information to the Circle Weaver that they do not want to share with other members.</b><p>

<p>In order to be completely transparent in the handling of information, users should be assured that all information uploaded or entered into a "workspace" is viewable only by other members of a workspace.  A "workspace" is specifically designed to be a container of information that is available only to the members of that workspace.  All users should be aware that there is no way that Circle Weaver Tech LLC can control what the other users of the workspace will do with the documents and information that you enter.  Other users may download that information and proceed to distribute it further.  When you input documents or information into a workspace, you are explicitly sharing that information with the other members of the workspace.</p>

<p>The membership in a workspace is under control of you and the other members of the workspace.  While an uninvited person can never access information in a workspace, new users can be invited and admitted to workspaces quite easily.  Users sharing information in a workspace must be aware that the membership of the workspace may change at any time.</p>

<p>Information you share in a workspace can be marked to be publicly accessible, and as such will be accessible to the public.  You are responsible to make sure that only information suitable for sharing with the public is marked to be accessible to the public.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Non-Collected Information</h2>

<p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Circle Weaver does not request or intentionally collect any other sensitive personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of information as client data. Users who store any sensitive personal information on our servers are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.</p>

<p>If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on Circle Weaver.  Circle Weaver does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use Circle Weaver without obtaining your parents' or legal guardians' consent.</p>

<p>We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in your repositories or other free-form content inputs. Client data shared in a workspace  belongs to the members of the workspace, and members are responsible for managing it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service. Any personal information within the client data of a workspace is the responsibility of the workspace owner.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Information</h2>

<p>We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Circle Weaver. For example, we may compile statistics on the patterns of usage of certain types of documents. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.</p>

<hr/>
<h1>Compelled Disclosure</h1>


<p>Circle Weaver Tech LLC may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.</p>

<p>In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, GitHub strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.</p>


<hr/>
<h1>Removal From the System</h1>

<p>We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected.</p>

<p>Any user may remove themselves from the system at any time by deleting their user profile.  They will need to log in successfully using the email address that they own, and then use the option to delete their user profile.   The required information associated with their profile (name, email, and icon image) will be erased permanently.  They will have no access to the system after that point.</p>

<p>Users may delete non-required information (such as uploaded documents or entered text information) from the workspace at any time.  Deleting is generally a two-step process.  First, the object in question is marked for delete by the user.  Second, the Site Administrator must perform a 'Garbage Collect' operation to effect the final deletion of the information.  Until the Garbage Collect is performed, the deleted item is available to be un-deleted by the user or others.  Users wishing immediate deletion of document or other information must mark it for deletion and then contact their Site administrator to perform the Garbage Collection immediately.</p>

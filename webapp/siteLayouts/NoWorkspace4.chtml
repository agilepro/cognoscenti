<h3>About Your Weaver Site: </h3>
<ul><h1><a href="">{$site.names|get(0)}</a></h1></ul>

<p class="important">You haven't created any workspaces yet.</p>


<p>Workspaces are where people do the work.  
Many people only need a single workspace, but you actually create as many workspaces as you want within one site.
Go ahead and create a workspace now.
Don't worry, you can create another later, or delete it, if you decide you need something different.</p>


<p>You can access the site at any time using one of the following links.   We recommend you bookmark one of these links right away:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="{$baseUrl}v/{$site.key}/$/SiteWorkspaces.htm">Workspaces</a> - a list of all workspaces in the site</li>
<li><a href="{$baseUrl}v/{$site.key}/$/SiteAdmin.htm">Site Admin</a> - the configuration options for the owner (you)</li>
<li><a href="{$baseUrl}v/{$site.key}/$/roleManagement.htm">Roles</a> - the roles (user groups) for the entire site</li>
</ul>

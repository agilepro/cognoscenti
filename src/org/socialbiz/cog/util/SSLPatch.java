/**
* It seems that the Java libraries for reading SSL connection have conflated
* two different things: the ability to have an encrypted line, and the ability
* to confirm who you are connecting to.  Both are important, but the implementation
* is that you can noly have both. Any connection, instead of giving you a simple
* option to check if the certificate on the other end is valid, throws an exception
* preventing you from reading anything at all.
*
* Here is why this is so rediculous.  If you use HTTP and connect to a server, you have
* no guarantee that the server is who it says it is, yet you can read the bytes.
* If you would like to read those bytes in privacy, you would like to use an SSL
* connection.  It does not matter what key is used, just so long as the line is encrypted
* then others will not be able to listen in.  In general it would be good to ensure that
* others can not listen in, especially when you are passing passwords over the line.
*
* Yet, the default implementation is that the encrypted line is denied you if you
* can't prove who the server is.  But in the unincrypted case you didn't know who the
* server was either.  Regardless of whether you know what the real identity of the server
* is that you are talking to, you are safer if the line is encrypted.
*
* Here is the issue: anyone can generate a key and provide a secure line.  It should
* be a standard feature of all web servers.  Basically, all web interactions should be over
* SSL.  But getting a certificate costs money, because you have to have the infrastructure
* to verify if the certificate is valid.  While SSL might be free, a certificate will
* always cost money.
*
* By forcing you to either have both privacy and certificate at the same time,
* effectively denies SSL privacy to those who do not have certificates!!
* Certificates can only be gotten for well named servers, which are generally in fixed
* location, and to known companies.  But what about laptops?  Getting a certificate
* for a portable machine is not reasonable.  Getting a certificate for a virtual
* machine for testing is not reasonable.  Yet, there are many temporary virtual machines
* and laptops that run servers.  But this is a decision that causes a client to fail
* when talking to these servers.
*
* Clearly the validation of a certificate is "information content" of the connect.
* It is a status flag that should be checkable.  If the application requires knowing
* that the certificate is valid, then it should have a way to check it.  But simply
* failing to connect is unnecessarily harsh.  It assumes too much about the needs
* of the client.
*
* So this class is implemented to disable the certificate validation checking.
* This, too, goes too far in the other way, this will consider all certificates
* valid whether they are or not.  It would be far better to determine whether the
* certificate is valid,and then allow the client to check, but I don't know how to
* do this.  This fix will allow Java clients to read data from HTTPS servers which
* do not have certificates.
*
* Calling SSLPatch.disableSSLException will disable such validation in the current
* VM until that VM is restarted.

If will be highlighted, and so if you're not satisfied with that name, you can just press Delete and type in the name you want.\n* NOTE: if you are attaching a newspaper or magazine article, you can eliminate all the clutter of advertisements by clicking VIEW AS A TEXT ONLY PAGE. You will then have a clean document that has full formatting (including links) but none of the distracting ads. (We at CircleWeaver often find it easier to read! ;-)\n* If you wish, type a description and add one or more labels.\n* Then, click ATTACH WEB URL to add the document to the document list.",

<h1>Hello!</h1> 

<p>We see that you have been using your Weaver site 
'<b>{$site.names|get(0)}</b>'
and things seem to be progressing.</p>

<p>We like to follow up with new users to interview them. 
We'd like know how you are using it. 
It would really help us to make Weaver better if we 
could understand what you like about it, 
as well as any improvements you'd like to see. 
</p>

<p>Can we schedule a half-hour phone interview with you? 
Please email to us at <b>Weaver@purplehillsbooks.com</b> 
and <b>Johnabuck@gmail.com</b> to 
let us know a couple of times that might work in your schedule.
</p>

<p>Looking forward to meeting with you,</p>

Keith Swenson &amp; John Buck

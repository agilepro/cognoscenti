<h3>About Your Weaver Site: </h3>
<ul><h1><a href="">{$site.names|get(0)}</a></h1></ul>

<p class="important">We invite you to create your first workspace in Weaver!</p>


<p>Workspaces are where people do the work.  
Many people only need a single workspace, but you actually create as many workspaces as you want within one site.
Go ahead and create a workspace now.
Don't worry, you can create another later, or delete it, if you decide you need something different.
See the short video Workspaces: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX13p4rnhb0&list=PL-y45TQ2Eb40eQWwH5NjyIjgepk_MonlB&index=2">How to Create in Weaver</a>.</p>

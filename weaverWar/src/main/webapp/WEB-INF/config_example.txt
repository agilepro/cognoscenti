#Configuration for Weaver (Cognoscenti) Server

# Library Folder
# This is the place that all sites/workspaces are saved.  
# Attachments are stored in the same folder with the project file.
# Make sure that this folder exists before you start.
libFolder=c:/opt/weaver_sites/


# User folder
# This is the location where the global user files will be stored.
# Can be any local path, include the complete path to the folder.
# Make sure that this folder exists before you start.
userFolder=c:/opt/weaver_user/


# baseURL
# This is the public base URL address which the browser will
# use to access this server.  Used for redirection of the browser.
# This must use host names that the browser can access.
# eg:   baseURL=http://myserver.example.com/weaver/
baseURL=http://localhost:8080/weaverWar/

# Identity Provider
# This is the address of a SSOFI identity provider that supports
# the Lightweight Authentication Protocol.  If this is set, then
# it will be possible for JS clients to authenticate to the server
# using this mechanism.  Note, the publicly available identity
# provider (default setting) will work for most installations.
# Be sure to include final slash!
# eg:   identityProvider=https://s06.circleweaver.com/ssofi/
identityProvider=https://s06.circleweaver.com/ssofi/


# Specify the user key that has administrator privilidges
# The user key is an internal key generated by the server when you log
* in the first time.   It is a 9-letter uppercase string.
# Note that you have to run the server and create a user account first
# and then reconfigure setting the ID of that user here.
# Multiple values can be set separated by commas.
#superAdmin=AAABBBCCC

#Force templates to be refreshed.  This works around a bug in the browsers
#that certain templates loaded with JavaScript are never refreshed.
#This is needed only on development servers where you might be 
#editing the templates directly, and want to see the change
#Set forceTemplateRefresh=false for production server, so it runs FASTER.
#Set forceTemplateRefresh=true to enable the slow, always refresh mode.
forceTemplateRefresh=true

/**
* This is a class that produces multi level numbers like this:
*
*  1.               L0
*  2.               L0
*  2.1              L1
*  2.2              L1
*  3.               L0
*  3.1              L1
*  3.1.1            L2
*  3.1.2            L2
* etc.
*
* Each request is made by asking for the next number, AT A PARTICULAR LEVEL.
* The numbers on the right represent the level of number that was asked for.
* The first call is for a number at level 0, then next at level 0 again.
* The third request is for a number at level 1.  In this case it leaves the
* top level 0 number the same, but increments the next level, and returns a
* two digit number.
*
* All you need to know is the level (depth) of the thing being numbered, and
* this will return the correct next number for that level.

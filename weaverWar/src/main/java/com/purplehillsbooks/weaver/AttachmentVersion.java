/**
* A project folder file versioning system just represents multiple files
* in a file system.  The primary version (the latest version) is kept directly
* in the project folder using the name of the attachment.  All version are
* stored in a subfolder named ".cog". and are named as the internal ID and
* appending the version number to that ID.
* For example the following might exist in the file system:
*
*     great-cars/CarStatistics.xls    (this is equal to version 5)
*     great-cars/.cog/9987-1.xls
*     great-cars/.cog/9987-2.xls
*     great-cars/.cog/9987-3.xls
*     great-cars/.cog/9987-4.xls
*     great-cars/.cog/9987-5.xls
*
* In this case, the project folder (container) is "great-cars"
* The attachment id is "9987" which is unique within the container.
* The hyphen number at the end is the version number of the attachment.
*
* The drawback of the project versioning system is obvious: all versions of all
* files are in the file system at the same time, taking up space.
* Also, the files are all stored local to one system.
* The advantage, however, is that it does not depend upon complex code
* to unpack or otherwise manipulate things to access the versions.
* Simply find the version by name, and stream it out.  Very fast.
*
* Disks are cheap, and if your documents are mostly binary, then there is
* little need to use a differencing algorithm to store more efficiently.
*
* The current version file is duplicated: it is both in the version folder
* and it is also with the access name in the main folder.  First reason
* is to enable accurate detection of changes when a person is editing directly.
* Second, if the file is deleted, the display copy is removed, but the
* versioned copy is still there for accessing deleted documents.  If user
* is editing directly, the former version is preserved this way.
*
* Date and time of the version is taken directly from the file system date.
*
* There is no record of who made the change, and other helpful metadata that
* you would get in a real versioning system.  Might think about adding another
* structure in the .cog folder to track that.
*
* The attachment can be in some funny states.  (FILE, EXTRA, GONE, or URL)
*
* "FILE" is the normal situation, there is a file in the main folder, and there
* is at least one version in the COG folder that exactly equals it.
*
* "URL" is data only, there are no files on the disk.
*
* "EXTRA" is when a file exists in the folder, but NO file in the COG folder
* This means that the file has appeared through user saving it.  User might
* want to commit this to make a version in the COG folder.
*
*     great-cars/CarStatistics.xls
*
* "GONE" means that there is one or more versions in the COG folder,
* but there is nothing in the main folder.  There are two options to
* rectify: delete the file, or restore from latest committed version.
*
*     great-cars/.cog/9987-1.xls
*     great-cars/.cog/9987-2.xls
*     great-cars/.cog/9987-3.xls
*
* "GHOST" - this state does not exist, but it means that there is an attachment
* record, and there is no file at all, neither in the main folder, nor in the COG.
* In this case the attachment record should be ignored?
*
* "DELETED" - this state is when the user deleted the file.  There should still be
* files in the COG folder.
*
* "MODIFIED" is when there are all the normal files, but the file has been modified
* in the main folder so that it is NOT the same as the highest numbered version in
* the COG folder.  In this case the list of versions is extended and one more
* is included to represent the file in the folder.

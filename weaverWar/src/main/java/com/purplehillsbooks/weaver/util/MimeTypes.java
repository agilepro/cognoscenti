/**
* As a web server that serves up attachments, it is important that the correct
* mime type calue be sent along with the file.
*
* According to the IETF, the mime type is supposed to be the primary way that a
* content of a file is identified, overriding any indication from the file name.
* Microsoft screwed up on this point int he early versions of Internet Explorer
* which would ignore mime type, and use only the file extension, and this led to
* a number of problems.  Later versions of IE (6.0 and later) use mime type to
* determine the content of a file, and NEVER the extension.  In fact, IE 7.0 and
* later refuse to use the file extension when the mime type is ambiguous, and instead
* inspect the stream.  This leads IE to conclude that pptx and docx are zip files,
* because actually they are zip files, and inspection shows that.  The fact is
* that you really want pptx to launch PowerPoint not Win zip.  Part of the
* problem is that the Java system does not come initialized properly to deliver
* the Microsoft mime types, and the refusal to include the proper mime type map
* table with Java is part of the Java/Microsoft war.
*
* Java includes a way to configure the mime type table, but does it in an error
* prone way.  Instead of associating the table with a server or a service, it is
* associated with the entire Java system.  Thus when you install your TomCat
* application, there is NO WAY to set up the mime type mapping table.
*
* It gets worse: the Java system is not clear on exactly how it gets initialized.
* The documentation says to put the mime type table in the java home lib directory,
* and I have seen that work, but there are other places you can put it that override
* this file.  At the moment I am writing this, I have a correctly configured mime
* type map file that used to work, but the Java system no longer is reading it.
* It is impossible to ask the system where it THINKS it is initializing itself
* from.  Where it reads from depends upon the user that it is running as, and
* it depends upon whether some other module in the system has programmatically
* altered the settings.  My suspision is that some lib module, because the Java
* approach is so arcane, has taken it upon themselves to "patch" it up, and thereby
* disabling the normal documented means to get it to work.  For whatever reasons,
* the mime type map is not working.
*
* Which brings us to the purpose of this class.  The default mime type value is
* "application/octet-stream".  This is the values that will cause IE to screw up.
* This class will leverage the Java system if it is functioning correclty.  But,
* this class will provide a way to OVERRIDE the Java supplied mime type, in the
* very likely probability that it will supply the wrong value.  This is kept as a
* simple property file in the application space.  If the application does not specify
* a type, then the normal Java supplied type will be used.

/**
* HttpServletResponse has this *strange* limitation that you can
* call getOutputStream() once, or getWriter() once, but not both.
*
* ONLY UTF-8 ENCODING!
*
* If any of the code, calls
* it a second time, it throws an exception telling you that it
* has already been called.  Here is the problem, it is impossible
* to know if a piece of code is the first time calling the method
* or not.  There are a lot of public libraries that help to handle
* responses, specifically the JSP page handlers, that assume they
* are the only thing needing access to the output stream.
* We end up writing elaborate code to attempt to track which bit of
* code needs the output handler, and avoiding getting it, and when
* getting it, putting it in a temporary variables, and forcing
* other code which is after that point to go to the variable, etc.
* It is all a lot of coding complication and involves setting in
* place patterns which the public libraries are not designed to handle.
*
* This class caches a copy of the output stream, and makes sure
* that getOutputStream on the super class is called only once
* and lets the method on this version be called more that once
* without throwing an exception.  This gives flexibility for a
* method that uses output stream for just a few moments to get it
* straint from the response class, and not worry whether it is
* the first routine making that request or not.
*
* We used to have a tremendous amount of trouble with
* HTTPServletResponse because the output stream can be reqeusted
* only once.  Some of the JSP support classes needed to be able
* to get the output stream from the response object.  When a
* Servlet calls another Servlet, the only parameter is a request
* and a response object, so if the first servlet gets the
* output stream, the second Servlet is completely hosed because
* it is unable to get the output stream, and there is no way to
* pass the stream to it.  This is a serious limitation.
*
* This is made particularly difficult because the JSP methods
* want to get a Writer, but our file attachment methods need
* a stream.  You can't construct the writer until you know the
* character encoding you are going to translate to.
*
* This is made even worse for handling exceptions.
* You want to get the output stream before the beginning of
* the try block, so that the same stream can be used for both
* writing the page, and also writing an exception if it
* occurs, but putting it outside the try block means you have to
* to get it before you need it, and it prevents any down-stream
* servlet from being the first to get it.  And you have to do this
* before you can decide whether you want a Stream or a Writer.
*
* If you wait until you know whether you want a Stream or a
* Writer, then you have a problem with the exception handling
* code, because that code can not ask for the output stream
* from the response object.
*
* A fairly bad solution is to declare a global stream variable
* initialized to null, and whenever the code determines whether
* it needs a Writer or a Stream, it puts it in that global.
* Everyplace else in the code needs to check that global variable
* to see if it is null or not, before it asks the request object.
* IF the global is null, it can ask the request object.
* But this does not work if you call another Servlet that uses
* a different way of solving the problem or has its own global
* variable.
*
* The real solution is HttpServletResponseWithoutBug which can
* be used to wrap the original request object, and it allows
* the stream to be fetched multiple times without problem.
* This solves all the problems.  Now servlets can call servlets,
* a servlet can call a JSP page, you can get the stream when you
* need it and use it without worrying that this will prevent
* exception code from doing the same.  It allows streams to be
* gotten outside of try blocks, and both the try and the
* catch block have access to a non-null variable.  You do not
* need to test for null everywhere because code can assure
* non-null up front.  It really solves a lot of problems

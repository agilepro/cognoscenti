For privacy information relating to these other third party websites, please consult their policies as appropriate.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A <b>cookie</b> is a small text file that our sites store on your computer or mobile device when you visit our websites. Our websites, apps and other services (“system”), send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website or app can access, store or collect information from your device when you first request a web page. Browsers support cookies and similar technologies (such as local storage and pixels) so that our websites can remember information about your visit and can use the information to improve your experience and to create aggregated anonymized statistics about usage of the site.

<h1>Transcription</h1>
    <p>This is a short tutorial on Weaver once you have a workspace you'll want to include others into the workspace so that they can participate in the activities there so this tutorial covers how to add a person to a workspace how to send them an invitation which simplifies things for them and how new users register so this is a typical workspace and everything is controlled through the roles of the workspace so you see a list of roles on the right here members administrators and facilitators and circle administrators and they're checked for the roles that that you're currently playing and also you'll see the list of members at the bottom the role that is most important is the members role if you're in the members role then you're going to have access to the workspace and so now you're seeing all the people that have access to the workspace so you control the roles with the roles tab over on the left so if you click on roles you'll see a list of all the roles and you'll see who's playing those roles at the current time in a bit of a description about it and if you click on the role it'll bring up the dialog box for editing who's the members of the roles now you see in the four people that are there if you start to enter someone who has already been in the system as you type three letters you'll you'll see them listed down below and you can just sort of pick them from from the list but I think it's more common that we find ourselves trying to add people to the workspace who have never actually accessed the system before and to do that you only need their email address that's it just knowing their email address I press return and now Charles here has access to the workspace if he was to come and to log in he would then be a member of this workspace and he would have full access so that's all you have to do to add a person to the workspace whether they whether they've been to the system before or not but in this case we have a user that's never been to the system now he'll start receiving notifications when the meeting announcements go out and and when new comments are created and topics are created he'll start getting those bayi some eventually something will draw him in but sometimes it's nice to go ahead and send an invitation so you can do that by clicking on the icon here and you can look at his profile and you can remove him here but this important one is to compose and send the invitation so here it's prefilled with some text that you may want to put in there but you can change that all right so once you've gotten the text that you want you click send invitation and now it says it sent it so let's go take a look and see what that would actually look like so Charles will receive a message that looks like this here's the here's the text that I typed in but down at the bottom it's prefilled with some links this message has been sent to his email address so by the time he clicks on this link we already know that he that this was delivered to his email click on the link so it's validated here that that he owns the amount or so all he has to do is set up his name and enter the password like normal so now he's set up his account he's now fully enabled and he's brought right to the workspace so now you can see he's a member he's a member of the members role and he now has access to the workspace so here's what we saw as someone who owned a workspace I simply entered someone's email address I then sent them an invitation and then based on that email that they received they were able to click and access the workspace and set up their password and name in a single action so it's really very easy to bring people into the workspace you can do that multiple times go back to two roles you can add any number of people at the same time you do need to go out and click on send invite if he loses the invite you can go ahead and send it again no problem you can send the invite as many times as you want to then until finally he hooks up and has access to the system so that's how you do it

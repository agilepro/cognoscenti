<h1>Acceptable Use Policy</h1>

<p>The intent of this document is to clarify what we consider to be acceptable use of any site, workspace or other aspect of&nbsp; Weaver Meeting Tech offerings.</p>

<p>If you are found to be in violation of any of the below policies, you will receive a notice via email. Unless you explain or correct your behavior within 72 hours, your account will be suspended. We will do our best to work with you and ensure a fair outcome in all cases. We reserve the right to immediately suspend, without notice, any content, account, or IP address which we determine to be submitting spam or other potentially damaging or disruptive content to the Network.</p>

<p>When your account is suspended, public access to content contributed under that account may be blocked or removed, and your account may be suspended or deleted at our discretion. Access to other functionality or information within the Network may also be blocked or disabled.</p>

<h2>Illegal Use</h3>

Weaver may not be used for illegal purposes. Examples of this include using Weaver for fraudulent purposes or operating a phishing site (used to obtain account and password information).

<h2>Spam</h3>

<p>Users that do not publish meaningful content, use deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic, or whose primary purpose is affiliate marketing, will be suspended.</p>

<h2>Identity Theft and Privacy</h3>

<p>Users that misleadingly appropriate the identity of another person are not permitted. Users may not post other people's personally identifying or confidential information, including but not limited to credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and driver's and other license numbers. You may not post information such as other people's passwords, usernames, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses unless already publicly accessible on the Web.</p>

<h2>Hate Content, Defamation, and Libel</h3>

<p>Hate speech and other objectionable content that is unlawful, defamatory, and fraudulent. Note that an allegation of defamatory expression, in and of itself, does not establish defamation. The truth or falsehood of a bit of expression is a key element in establishing defamation, and we are not in a position to make that sort of fact-based judgment. That said, if we have reason to believe that a particular statement is defamatory (a court order, for example), we will remove that statement.</p>

<h2>Disruptions and Exploits.</h3>

<p>We will terminate accounts and block addresses of those who attempt unauthorized use of the Weaver System.</p>

<h2>Copyright</h3>

<p>Users must only share information that they have permissions to share.  Using copyrighted material does not constitute infringement in all cases.  It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement sent to Weaver Tech LLC that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").</p>

<h2>Mass Registration and Automation</h3>

<p>Accounts that are registered automatically or systematically will be removed and access will be permanently suspended.</p>

<h2>Sexually Explicit Material</h3>

<p>Accounts that use Weaver to post sexually explicit or pornographic material, or links to it, will be suspended.</p>

    <p>hi again this is Keith Swenson and today I'd like to talk a little bit about how you use markdown in Weaver in order to style text in the cases where you need to use it markdown is a simple straightforward way to style text it's used by many many web applications Wikipedia github slack these are just a few examples I can remember off the top of my head there's really many more the main rules are quite simple you type the text in blank lines make a new paragraph a few characters at the beginning of the line styles the block a few characters before and after a span of text style the text I think you'll see that just by typing a few characters it's very very easy to style text in the way that you need it Here I am in a meeting and we're looking at the first meeting agenda item and if we go to the notes section we can double clink here bring up the editor and this is markdown you just type in what you want so you just type the text in and if you type text line after line they'll be combined together into a single paragraph but if you want to have a separate paragraph leave a blank line let me show you what this looks like so here you have the three paragraphs as they were let me double click again on this to edit it now one of the things about when we have the markdown editors we color the text brown just so that it's a little reminder that this is markdown if you look at the rich text editor it looks different it's gonna be black text it's gonna have this header bar up here but with markdown you don't need that you do all the styling with characters and in fact there's this little reminder panel here at the beginning of a block if you put a asterisk you're going to get a bullet two asterisks you get a second level bullet or a third level bullet with three headings are the same sort of thing with exclamation marks three exclamation marks is heading one two and one exclamation marks heading three then if you want to style a span of text you can style it into italics by using two single quotes before and two single quotes after you can style it into bold with two underscores before and two underscores after then and I'll show this in detail hypertext hyperlinks are done with square brackets before and after the text you want to make the - things really that's all the rules let's just try this out a little bit here we want to make some bullet points here so this is the first bullet and this is the second bullet and sure enough these are now displayed as bullets if we want a second-line bullet in between you just to use two asterisks and now you have an indent bullet it actually goes up to five different levels of bullets same thing with headings if you want to have a heading heading one and down at the bottom let's make a heading two and we'll save that and sure enough these are a bigger font that's the third level heading and if you use more exclamation marks you get a bigger heading okay so that's um styling of blocks but then let's take a look at the we're gonna do some italics and some bold so let's go back to there with italics and okay and let me just save that and sure enough you see we have here italics and bold the last and final thing to know about markdown is hyperlinks so let's put a hyperlink in here you just put a square bracket around the hyperlink like that and let me just close this and now we see this is a hyperlink here it's active and when I click on it it takes me to Google search no surprise there sometimes you want your link to have a text here which is different than the hyperlink and so in that case you put the tight the text that you want there and you put a vertical bar and then you put the address there and then look at what you got here please see this google search and of course when you click on it it's Google search could hardly be easier than that so to summarize markdown it's a simple straightforward way to style text it's used by many many web applications the main rules are use a blank line to make a new paragraph a few characters at the beginning of line style that block into either bullets or headings a few characters before and after a span style the text that's all you need to know now go and try it and see how easy it is you

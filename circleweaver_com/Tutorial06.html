    <p>
    Hi, this is another tutorial on Weaver. Today's topic should have been "Managing Junk," but that's not the nice way to say it. So, we'll call it "Managing Lots of Documents." I'll show you how to do labels I'll show you how to do filtering and to do folders. 
    </p> 
    <p> Here we have a workspace. In this workspace we happen to have a large number of documents, and this will happen from time to time. The list goes on. Documents are shown normally in order of most recently updated, and that's usually the way you want to see things: You generally want to see what's been changed, and the documents that you want to see it will appear at the top that way. 
    </p>
    <p>  But again, when you have a long list of documents, you need to go back and see some of the old documents. It can be kind of hard to read all through this. So the first technique you want to know is about filtering. There's a filter box here, and if you know anything about the name of the document you can type it in. So, if you know there's something about Google in here you just type a few letters and suddenly that instantly appears in front of you. It's quite fast. If you know that, there's a jar file in here somewhere. You type "jar" and those get selected. Also notice if I teach HMRC, it's bringing up a list of documents here. But, in many cases these appear in the description. So, you're searching both the name of the document and the description, and it's blazingly fast. So, that's why we don't offer sorting by name because sorting by name doesn't really help you unless you're sure what it starts with. Of course, you could just type that letter in. But if you have a lot of documents and there's a lot of people doing it, there's some other things you can do. 
    </p>  
<p> Here's another workspace and in this case it's sort of a development folder. We have a lot of documents, but what we've done here is we've made use of the labels. So, let me show you how labels work. There's a tab for labels and you click on that. And here's the list the labels. The labels have to be set up in advance they can be set up at any time, but you need to think and and figure out what kinds of you want. This one has labels for release one two and three, and it's got labels for specs and and requirements. 
  </p>
 <p> It's quite easy to change these. You click the edit button. You can change its color, you can you can change its name, and save it back. So, in just a moment you can create a new label without any problem, and there it is so back to the documents. 
   </p>
  <p> We see that a lot of these have been tagged with labels, and you'll see some are tagged with release one and release two and and user documents and requirements. If you want a filter, you need only to click on the label that you're interested in. So you click on release one, and now you're only going to see the release 1 documents. And if you click on spec, you're only going to see the two specs. If you click on the label again, it'll undo it. You can also pick the filter from the list of labels up here so that if you want to see all the specs you can choose spec. Here you're seeing specs from multiple different releases. 
  </p>
  <p>  Now notice here at the top is a document which does not have any label. So let me demonstrate how you would set a label on a document. You can go into here and edit the document details that'll get you there. But, there's a there's a shortcut, and that is if you just click these little icons here, that takes you to the Edit document details panel. Here's the little labels button and you can choose "moment," and you can choose "release three." Don't forget to press Save Changes. If I save those changes, I'll now see that this document has been labeled with those labels and is immediately available for filtering. It's similarly easy to remove the label. Just go into here, click on the label that you want to remove, and don't forget to save your changes. This approach will work for most applications for most situations it's quite easy to simply choose a filter. I want to look at release three. I'm going to look at user documentation and there it is. 
    </p>
  <p>  But we offer another mode and that's called the "show folders" mode. Show folders you can drill down through the labels, and it presents them as if they're folders. For example, if I'm interested in release one, I click that it tells me about these kind of documents. For release one I'm looking for the specifications. I click and now I'm seeing only the documents that are specifications for release one. 
  </p>
    <p> Similarly I can go back up to release one. And you'll back up to the main workspace. If I want to see all the specifications, I click on spec. Now notice there's nothing here because this approach only shows you exact matches with all of the labels. So since all of the specs are either labeled release one, two, or three, you won't see anything at this level. But once you pick release one, you'll now see the documents for that level. So, if you have a large number of documents, this becomes an easy way to sort of browse around, and it's telling you what doesn't exist and what does exist. If you if you choose, for instance, this category of routine you'll see that routine exists in release one and two and it doesn't exist in release three. So it's pretty easy to find what does and doesn't exist. Of course in this approach when you're at the root you're seeing only documents that have absolutely no labels on it. So we have here our Tuolumne Meadows trailheads. I'm not sure what that document is doing in this project, but it clearly comes to the top when you use the folders method.
      </p> 
   <p> So that's it. I've shown you how labels work, how you can set up labels, and you can apply labels to documents. I've shown you how you can filter documents according to their labels and easily multiple labels. And, I've also shown you folder view, which presents labels as if they were document folders organized into a folder hierarchy. And it drills down and shows you only the exact matches with all of the labels you're looking for.
    </p>

    <h2>Client Data Content Permissions & Licensing</h2>

    <p>Weaver is a system for sharing information.  When you place information into Weaver, you are instructing us to share that with the other members of that workgroup, in the way that the workspace has been set up to share it.  For us to do this job, you must give us permission to do it, and the following legal statement simply says this without ambiguity.</p>

    <p>
    You agree that any and all content that you place into the Weaver system, including without limitation any and all documents, spreadsheets, text, graphics, logos, tools, photographs, images, illustrations, software or source code, audio and video, animations, etc. that you provide to the Weaver System (collectively, “Client Data”), is perpetually and irrevocably licensed to Weaver on a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive basis pursuant to Creative Commons licensing terms (CC BY-SA 4.0), and you grant Weaver the perpetual and irrevocable right and license to access, use, process, copy, distribute, export, display and to commercially exploit such Client Data, even if such Client Data has been contributed and subsequently removed by you as reasonably necessary to, for example (without limitation):</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and update the public Network</li>
    <li>Process lawful requests from law enforcement agencies and government agencies</li>
    <li>Prevent and address security incidents and data security features, support features, and to provide technical assistance as it may be required</li>
    <li>Aggregate data to provide product optimization</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This means that you cannot revoke permission for Weaver to publish, distribute, store and use such content solely in order to fulfill its services or obligations and to allow others who can access your site/space as per respective settings to have derivative rights to publish, distribute, store and use such content. </p>

NOTHING IN THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL PREVENT WEAVER’S RIGHT TO SEEK AND OBTAIN EQUITABLE RELIEF. NOTWITHSTANDING SUCH RIGHT OF EQUITABLE RELIEF, TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT PERMIT SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY, SUCH LIMITATION WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

    <h1>Transcript</h1>
    
    <p>
Hi my name is Keith Swenson. I am
recording this as a quick introduction
to Weaver for the first-time user.
</p>
<p>
You've
probably come upon Weaver because you're
participating in some group that's using
it you only need to know a few things
about Weaver
so let's go into that.
</p>
</div>
<div class="white-section">
<h2>Four Main Objects</h2>
<p>
<img src="tutorial-files/Tutorial01-snap1.png" class="tutorialThumbnail"/>
</p>
<p>
In Weaver there
are four key things we're keeping track
of we're going to keep track of meetings
documents discussion topics and action
items.
</p>
<p>
Mmeetings hold meeting agendas and all of
the notes around a meeting it's to help
you get everybody together have
everybody on the same page before you
start it helps you to run the meeting
and and it helps you to track what's
going on and keep records of what
happened in meetings. 
</p>
<p>
The second major
thing we we track is documents these are
files they can be Word files they can be
spreadsheets they could be PDF files
whatever it is they can be also included
together with the meetings. 
</p>
<p>
Discussion
topics are if there's something that you
want to have a discussion on you want to
bounce it back and forth and maybe it's
something that you're thinking about but
not sure about yet and so you want to
open it up for discussion discussion
topic works like a discussion forum.
</p>
<p>
Finally action items these this is your
to-do list these are things that need to
be addressed.
</p>
</div>
<div class="purple-section">
<h2>Workspaces</h2>
<p>
<img src="tutorial-files/Tutorial01-snap2.png" class="tutorialThumbnail"/>
</p>
<p>
All of these are held
together in a thing called a workspace
so there will be a lot of workspaces in
the system each workspace has a set of
people groups of people who can access
that workspace. If you're just
starting out you may just be involved in
one workspace and that's the only
workspace you can access or maybe as
time goes on you may participate in
multiple workspaces. Each workspace is a
completely separate space for keeping
all of your meetings your documents your
discussion topics and your action items.
</p>
</div>
<div class="white-section">
<h2>Front Page</h2>
<p>
<img src="tutorial-files/Tutorial01-snap3.png" class="tutorialThumbnail"/>
</p>
<p>
Now when you see this -- I'll give you a
demo in a moment -- but when you see the
user interface you'll see a set of
navigational items on the left-hand side
of the screen and so under Weaver if you
ever get lost click on front page.  Front
page gives you a high-level summary of
what's going on in the word
space it's got all the latest action
items the latest things that have
happened and then from there you can get
on to some of the other parts of the
work space
</p>
</div>
<div class="purple-section">
<h2>Main Four Links</h2>
<p>
<img src="tutorial-files/Tutorial01-snap4.png" class="tutorialThumbnail"/>
</p>
<p>
Back to those four
main things meetings it's right there
the meetings link will take you there
the topics link will take you to
discussion topics documents link will
take you to the documents objects and
action items of course will take you to
the list of action items
</p>
<p>
So let me show
you what this looks like so here's a
workspace in Weaver and if you want to
see a list of the meetings you click on
the meetings and that's what you're
seeing here is all of the meetings.  Some
of these will run in the past here's one
that may be run in the future if you
want to see what the meetings about you
click on the meeting this is going to
show you the overview of: when the
meeting is; where it's going to be; and
it's also gonna show you here
representation of the agenda
so using this agenda you could plan for
what you're going to talk about.
</p>
<p>
If you
click on the title of the agenda it
opens up.  There may be some more
information in here some more details
this may be assigned to a single person
and as you know when the meetings being
run you can use this to help run through
the meeting.  
</p>
<p>
If you are planning on
attending you can indicate before the
meeting starts you can indicate that
you're going to attend and you can see
if anybody else is going to attend the
meeting so that's meetings.
</p>
<p>
Discussion
topics are again anything that you want
to discuss about.  It's pretty easy to
create a topic just click there and
create it.  When you go into looking at a
discussion topic there are places where
people can make comments on here and you
can go back and forth and respond to
comments.  Emails get sent out along with
these so discussion topics are a way of
sort of coming bringing the group to a
single space.
</p>
<p>
Documents might look
like this.  These are a list of
documents which have been put into the
workspace for everybody to be able to
access.  If you click on the the title of
the document you'll get to a download
page.  To access almost everything you
have to do a download of the file and
then of course you you load it in
as into your application that uses it
just like normal.  If you want to add
documents it's quite straightforward.  You
click add documents decide if you want
to upload or if you want to link a URL or
attach it from Google Documents.   If
you upload it's quite simple: you just
simply drag a document onto the drag
field and you'll get a place where you
can describe it (e.g. you should all read this
before the meeting) so they get an idea of
what relationship this has to do with
anything else and you click upload.
</p>
<p>
You're done and so now it's going to
list it's now going to be there in the
list of documents that are part of the
workspace.
</p>
<p>
The last thing was action
items so your action items list is going
to contain a list of action items
whatever your group has been working on.
</p>
<p>
If you're assigned one of these
you can update the status by clicking on
the status and say I'm getting this done
you can indicate green yellow red
depending on whether things are going
well so if you think it's going like
like that
you can also set if you're tracking a
due date on this you could you could
track a particular due date and save it
down there so this becomes a display
where you can everybody can see the
status as it's going along.  Eventually
you get to the point where you want to
complete an action item and you'll use
this mark completed here another thing
you can do is you can accept the action
item that just basically tells everybody
else that you're you're working on it
and then later of course when you
complete it when you complete the item
it'll disappear from this view.  You can
see completed items by clicking the
completed items checkbox.
</p>
</div>
<div class="white-section">
<h2>Four Smaller Objects</h2>
<p>
<img src="tutorial-files/Tutorial01-snap5.png" class="tutorialThumbnail"/>
</p>
<p>
Those are the four main things in a
weaver workspace: meetings, discussion
topics, documents, and action items. Now
there's also a few other things that are
that are less important or at least
you'll use them less often but I'll
touch on them briefly here.
</p>
<p>
There's also
a set of decisions as you work through
things with meetings you'll be making
decisions and those decisions will be
recorded so you can click there and take
a look at that.
</p>
<p>
There's a set of labels
labels can be used to help organize the
documents and the discussion topics that
are in there.
</p>
<p>
Roles are quite
important there's a list of of people
that are assigned different things.
</p>
<p>
Finally I mentioned here email we don't
I don't have a menu item here for the
email but it's also an important thing
of what's going on let me show you how
those are.
</p>
<p>
So this is where your
decisions would appear and these may be
linked back to conversations that
created them it's pretty straightforward. 
If you want to see there's a set of
labels labels can be created and here so
that you have a set of labels to assign
to things.
</p>
<p>
Roles are listing the people here that
are assigned to the various roles if
you're new to the space you probably
won't be doing anything in the roles but
you can at least see this and see who's
playing which which positions.
</p>
<p>
Finally there's also a list of email
which has been sent at various times and
you know the email goes out and it'll
look a little bit like this.  You may
receive some of these emails as part of
working with it generally there are
links in the emails that will take you
back to the workspace so they're from
the email you can go right to the
workspace.
</p>
</div>
<div class="purple-section">
<h2>User Home Page</h2>
<p>
<img src="tutorial-files/Tutorial01-snap6.png" class="tutorialThumbnail"/>
</p>
<p>
So that's the workspace I sort
of took you through all of the various
different parts of it and you can see
them all listed down here on the left.
</p>
<p>
As
for outside of the workspace you should
pay attention a little bit to the top
bar up here.  First of all if you ever get
lost you can click the Weaver icon and
it'll take you to his place that has all
of your stuff now this is across all the
workspaces you're working on if you're
only working on one workspace you may
see only one workspace in here under the
user here you can get to your profile
settings you can get to a couple of
other information about what's going on
and then under the workspace pulldown
this is gonna list all the workspaces
that you've been to recently as well as
all your watched workspaces your
template workspaces any workspaces you
administer or participate or all the
workspaces so this pull down here is for
all of the
workspaces that you're involved in.
</p>
<p>
If
you need to find something in the system
use the search button just type in a
search term and click return and it'll
find whatever places where that that
term appears in all across all of the
workspaces that you participate in.
</p>
<p>
So I
hope that gives you an idea for a quick
introduction to Weaver and to help you
to be effective from the beginning

			  <h2>The Short Version</h2>
			   <p>Circle Weaver Tech is dedicated to providing a system for people to use to collaborate with each other more effectively.  The purpose of a collaboration system is to allow a way for people to share "client data" (information of any type including files, documents, discussions, agreements, commitments, status, etc) with each other.  Users of Weaver have control over what client data they add to the system and to whom it is shared.</p>

				<p>Beyond client data, we require a minimal amount of personal information that is necessary to run the system.  We collect and process only the information you choose to give us for the goal of collaborating with other users of the service.</p>

				<p>Circle Weaver Tech does not own, control, or direct the client data that you share in a workspace.  Only authorized users can access your client data (generally they must be members of the workspace but there are some special cases identified below).  We take all the standard precautions to make sure that your client data is not accessible by others who are not members of the workspace.  Because we do not control your client data, Circle Weaver Tech is not acting in the capacity of a data controller with regards to your client data.  You client data is yours, and we do not give or sell your client data to anyone.  We share it only with people you direct us to share it with as part of running a collaboration site.</p>

				<p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p>

				 <h3>Privacy Policy Details</h3>
					 <p>Any personal information processed by Circle Weaver in connection with this Privacy Policy is controlled by Circle Weaver Tech LLC, which is considered the "data controller" of your personal information under applicable data protection law. </p>

					<p><em>Personal information</em> means details which identify you or could be used to identify you, such as your name, your email address, and your interaction history. It may also include information about how you use our websites and mobile applications.</p>

					<p>Circle Weaver is a collaboration site.   The purpose of a collaboration site is to help people collaborate.  To do that, people need to contact other people and exchange information with them.</p>

					<p><em>Client Data</em> means that information that you add to Weaver specifically to share with other members of your workspace.  The Weaver software gives the user the ability to add, remove, and control access to client data.  This may include personal and non personal data.  Circle Weaver Tech does not own, control, or direct the client data that you share in a workspace.</p>

					<p><em>Controlled personal information</em> is personal information which the Circle Weaver site prompts for and uses for the running of the site.  
					Controlled personal information is the subject of this privacy policy and is detailed in the next section.</p>

					<p><em>Non-controlled information</em> is the client data, such as documents, comments, discussion topics, action items, descriptions, etc. 
					which you place on the site for collaboration with others and may include personal and/or non-personal information.    
					Circle Weaver will only allow client data to be accessed by whoemever you specify for sharing with.  
					Non-controlled information is not the subject of this privacy policy 
					which means that you and the other members of your workspace are responsible for 
					controlling this client data with regard to any data controlling requirements that you might have.</p>

			 <h3>Required Information</h3>

				<h4>Email Address</h4>

				<p>All participants are required to provide an email address.  An email address is required to serve as a globally unique identification number, so that access control to all information can be accurately implemented.  A functioning email address is required so that you can set up and manage a password to authenticate yourself to the system.  All users are authenticated using an email address and a password.</p>

				<p>This email address is never sold to others.  The email address is used only to communicate to you as required to perform the function of collaboration and to inform you of import information about the running of the system.  The function of a collaboration site is to inform you of actions of others, of new materials available, of changes in status of objects in the system.  As part of using Circle Weaver you will receive email messages for these purposes of informing you of updates in the system.</p>

				<p>Your email address will be visible to others that are using the system.  As you update or modify things in the system, a trace of those updates is kept and other users of the system will see who it is that has done these changes.  Since your email address serves as a unique id, it is used to uniquely identify the changes that you have performed on the system.  If you never modify any object in the system, and never interact with the objects, then no trace of modifications will be available for others to see.</p>

				<p><em>Because the purpose of a collaboration system is to make others aware of the changes that others make in the shared information, all users of Circle Weaver must implicitly accept that records of their actions within the system are disclosed to other people using the system.</em></p>

				<p>If you wish to use Circle Weaver without your personal email address being seen by others, you are encouraged to obtain and use a email address from a free or low cost supplier, like GMail or competitor to use as a unique ID and as a way to receive communications from Circle Weaver.  If you are not able to find a suitable vendor for this, an obfuscated email address can be provided for a reasonable charge not to exceed $25/month by making a written request to Circle Weaver Tech LLC.</p>

				<h4>Full Name</h4>

				<p>Each user provides a full name which is used as a label for the records of the actions that you take in the system.  Your name will be disclosed to other users of the system.</p>

				<p>You are allowed to enter an alias.  You can set your name to be any value that you wish, and that will be the name that others in the system will identify you as.</p>

				<h4>Trace (History) Records</h4>

				<p>As mentioned above, as you take actions in the system, records of the actions you take are retained in order to let others know what you have done.  For example, if you upload a document to the system, your name and id will be associated with the document so that others know who uploaded it.  If an action item is assigned to you, then other users in the system (with appropriate access rights) will be able to see the task and see that it is assigned to you.  This is the very purpose of a collaboration system.</p>

				<h4>Cookies</h4>

				<p>Cookies are a technology feature of a browser that allows you to log into Circle Weaver, and for the software to reliably identify you as you access other pages.  When you log in, a cookie is supplied to the browser, and subsequent requests on your behalf will be trusted only if that cookie is returned as part of the request.  This is how authentication and access control works.</p>

				<p>Cookies are also given to the browser to save the login id that you have used in the past, simply as a convenience to make it easier to log in the next time you visit.</p>

				<p>You may clear your cookies at any time, but you will lose your current logged in session, and you will not be allowed access until you log in again.</p>

				<h4>Icon Image</h4>

				<p>A user may set an image to represent them on the site.  This image might be a personal photo of their head, or it might be anything else.  If the user uploads a personal photo of themselves as their icon, they must be aware that others using the site will be able to see that image.  If you do not wish a personal image to be seen by other users, you should use some other, non-personal image, as your icon image.</p>

			  <h3>Client Data</h3>
			   <p>Circle Weaver is a site people use to collaborate with each other.  It is a site for sharing information.  Circle Weaver has no control of the type or nature of information that the users may wish to share.   Client Data includes:

				<ul>
				<li>Documents or files of any type that are uploaded to the site</li>
				<li>Web pages or Google documents which are linked to the site via hyperlink</li>
				<li>Notes or discussion topic entries composed on the site.</li>
				<li>Meeting information including agenda, notes, and comments from users</li>
				<li>Action item that represent requests that others do tasks, and they can track which tasks have been completed or not.</li>
				<li>Comments, proposals and 'rounds' entered by users and attached to documents, links
				 or enter information in comments or discussion topics.</li>
				<li>Decision entries entered into the decision list</li>
				<li>Details of role descriptions</li>
				<li>Description fields on all these artifacts that are there to help explain the reason that these artifacts are included in the site</li>
				<li>keyword tags used to classify edocuments, discussions, and action items</li>
				</ul>

							</p>
				<p>Client data entered by users into the Circle Weaver site will be shared to others in the way that the client specifies them to be shared.  Circle Weaver Tech takes reasonable precautions to assure that client data is accessible only to people that you specify to share with.  We have documentation and training videos explaining to user how to safely share this information with others.</p>

				<p><b>Users should never upload or enter highly personal information to the Circle Weaver that they do not want to share with other members.</b></p>

				<p>A <b>workspace</b> is the primary construct for controlling the access to client data.  All client data is associated with a single specific workspace when it is uploaded, linked, or entered into a web page from that workspace.  Client data stays within one workspace unless it is specifically moved by a user to another workspace.   Each workspace has its own set of members who are users who can access all information in a workspace.  For the most part, all client data is accessible to all workspace members, and not accessible to any workspace non-members.</p>  

				<p>There are a couple of special situations where non-members can be authorized to access client data from a workspace: for example documents attached to a meeting will be available to people invited to a meeting regardless of whether they are members; documents attached to a discussion will be accessible to subscribers of that discussion; and 'share ports' are a specific construct to any specific client data to be shared to anyone who receives the special link to the share port.  These authorization mechanisms are outlined in the documentation and should be carefully studied by all active users.</p>

				<p>All users should be aware that there is no way that Circle Weaver Tech LLC can control what the other users of the workspace will ultimately do with the documents and information that you enter.  Other users may download that information and proceed to distribute it further.  When you input documents or information into a workspace, you are explicitly sharing that information with the other members of the workspace and trusting that those members are adhering to any handling guidelines for the group.</p>

				<p>The membership in a workspace is under control of you and the other members of the workspace.  While a non-member can never access information in a workspace, any user can be invited and admitted to workspaces quite easily by any member of the workspace.  Users sharing information in a workspace must be aware that the membership of the workspace may change at any time.  Members of a workspace must determine and enforce their own guidelines for who else can be admitted as a member.</p>

				<p><b>Sensitive personal information should never be uploaded or entered into Weaver.</b>
				Information such as credit card numbers, sensitive medical history, industrial or military secrets, and any damaging person information should never be entered into any system which has the purpose to share information.  A good guideline is that any information that would be inappropriate to post on the team room wall should not be shared in Weaver.</p>

			<h3>Non-Collected Information</h3>

			<p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Circle Weaver does not request or intentionally collect any other sensitive personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of information as client data. Users who store any sensitive personal information on our servers are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.</p>

			<p>If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on Circle Weaver.  Circle Weaver does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use Circle Weaver without obtaining your parents' or legal guardians' consent.</p>

			<p>We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in your repositories or other free-form content inputs. Client data shared in a workspace  belongs to the members of the workspace, and members are responsible for managing it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service. Any personal information within the client data of a workspace is the responsibility of the workspace owner.</p>

			<h3>Aggregated Information</h3>

			<p>We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Circle Weaver. For example, we may compile statistics on the patterns of usage of certain types of documents and use this information to optimize the operation of the servers.   However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.</p>

				 <h3>Compelled Disclosure</h3>
					<p>Circle Weaver Tech LLC may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.</p>

					<p>In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Circle Weaver Tech strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.</p>

			<h3>Removal From the System</h3>

			<p>We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected.</p>

			<p>Any user may remove themselves from the system at any time by deleting their user profile.  They will need to log in successfully using the email address that they own, and then use the option to delete their user profile.   The required information associated with their profile (name, email, and icon image) will be erased permanently.  They will have no access to the system after that point.</p>

			<p>Users may delete client data (such as uploaded documents or entered text information) from the workspace at any time.  Deleting is generally a two-step process.  First, the object in question is marked for delete by the user.  Second, the Site Administrator must perform a 'Garbage Collect' operation to effect the final deletion of the information.  Until the Garbage Collect is performed, the deleted item is available to be un-deleted by the user or others.  Users wishing immediate deletion of document or other information must mark it for deletion and then contact their site administrator to perform the garbage collection immediately.</p>

<h1>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation from the European Union (EU) that aims to harmonize data-protection legislation across EU member states by enhancing privacy rights for individuals. It applies to organizations processing personal data that offer goods or services to individuals in the EU. It also grants EU-based data subjects certain rights to control the data that organizations collect on them, and how organizations use that information.</p>

<p>Weaver Tech LLC is committed to your privacy, whether you live in the EU, or outside of it. This means we apply GDPR principles to all of our processes. We believe in having appropriate systems to ensure compliance.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are purchasing Weaver products or services, we want you to know that we take our responsibilities to protect the personal data of our community very seriously.</p>


<h2>Weaver and Data Security</h2>

<p>Weaver is committed to security by design in our products and services. Our Development and Security teams are hard at work to ensure we protect the data you entrust to us. We base our systems on ISO 27001 principles.



<h2>Information for Data Subjects</h2>

<p>Weaver users meet the GDPR definition of data subjects. The GDPR provides enhanced rights to individuals including the right to data portability and the right to erasure, also known as the right to be forgotten, the right to restrict processing and the right to object. You have the ability to exercise these rights by submitting a written request to Weaver Tech LLC. Because we care about your privacy rights we make these access requests available to you whether you are in the EU or not.</p>

<p>Weaver now makes it easy for you to request any information we store on you, to understand how that information has been collected, and to know who we have shared your information with. Weâ€™ve revised our <a href="PrivacyPolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="CookiePolicy.html">Cookie Policy</a> to provide more details about how we collect, use, transfer, and safeguard your information.</p>

<p>Users can decide which categories of cookies they consent to or withdraw consent by visiting their Cookie Settings.</p>

<p>Weaver is a collaboration platform where users share information and documents with each other.  Weaver Tech LLC does not and can not control the information that the users share with each other, elsewhere called "Client Data."  For to most part, the members of each workspace adopt and control the information shared there.   If you know of any client data that violates the <a href="AcceptableUsePolicy.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a> please let Weaver Tech LLC know and it will be removed.

<h1>Transcription</h1>
    <p>hello again this presentation is about running a meeting with Weaver in the last video I showed you how to set up for a meeting and we created a meeting with a number of agenda points if you haven't seen that you probably want to watch that first but now we'll talk about how to record the attendees of the meeting take notes create action items and create decision objects so here's the meeting that we had planning for a block party and there's a couple of things people have been sent email about this and they're able to access this meeting page if they would like they can click on the calendar icon here and this will download a calendar file which will place a meeting reminder on their own calendars so the date and the time comes for the meeting and you have to manually put it into run mode so putting it into run mode says we're now running the meeting people can access this during the meeting there's different styles of meetings there's most people are running a face-to-face meeting you're sitting around a table you're in an actual room you're in a room with a bunch of chairs and maybe a podium in that case most of the meetings going to happen right there live and that's the most effective way most efficient way to run a meeting once you've been prepared for it bring everybody there and have the meeting but more and more often there are meetings being held long distance where people are joining over the phone they're joining through a some sort of desktop sharing software and in that case they're using a computer they're they're seeing things on the screen and they will probably be accessing this meeting record itself so you can you can also look for some some participation there and there's another aspect to this which is we're not always available at the place and time of the meeting and so if you know you're going to miss a meeting you can still participate by going in in advance and putting in a comment so that basically saying the points you'd like to make now of course it's no real replacement for being there but it's better than nothing so you just have to decide if that's worth while now a lot of people when they run a meeting they have an opening round and you'll go through and make sure that everybody's part of the whole meeting now I didn't make an opening around in this but the first thing you can do in a meeting is actually make make changes to the agenda so I'm going to move the opening round up to the top and as this mean typically goes will probably have a closing round as well so let me go ahead and do that start and close the meeting if your style of meeting is that way you probably would have put those in in the first place now as people show up to the meeting you can record their attendance it's very easy to add yourself you click this button and you become added in there and anybody can do this so anybody in the meeting they can go click there and add themselves that way they they they know they've been recorded as being there or since some people may not have access to computers and some people may not be into the whole meeting on a website thing you can easily enter them also in by using their email address so you have a record of who actually attended the meeting and this is of course separate from the the record of who was invited so we get to the opening round now sometimes it's the person who is running the meeting that is taking those sometimes you have the note-taker as a separate person either way you can take your notes directly into here now you have a couple of options Commons proposals rounds and minutes but for a meeting what you really want to be doing is creating minutes the difference between a minutes option it's a very much like a comment but it doesn't send email and it's not designed to be sort of a discussion it's just a place to enter things in store so um I'm not going to enter anything intelligible here but you can easily imagine that if I was I could take notes here and keep track of of what was being set in an opening-round you might you might be asking each for and what their current status is so you would enter that in here just as notes so it's just text-based notes it's really simple straightforward when you when you click post you that becomes an entry in here so you're finished with the opening round you go to the next one you start discussing that you start taking notes on the second item and maybe in some cases we if we move on to the third one there's already a comment here that's okay I can still take my minutes as a separate item right next to that and you can go back and re-edit these as many times as you want in the case of a comment the person who made the comment can go back and re-edit that also as many times as they want so you're working your way down the agenda now what you want to be doing in meetings is making decisions so if you get to the point where it looks like you're coming to consensus on something you're coming to agreement and you think you can make a decision again if everybody is in the room and they're the most efficient way is going to be to look around the room and do this face-to-face someone would make a proposal and you would see if everybody agreed with that that's the associate kradic way of doing it you don't you don't vote and pick something that the majority of the people vote on but instead you make a proposal make sure that everybody's in agreement with it you can do that specifically in the system so for example in this case of choose a band if you decide to go with the green tomatoes you could whoever's taking the notes whoever's doing that could make a proposal and that is we should get the green tomatoes for the band okay so you you put that in there and what that does is it gives you the proposal there this is shared this is actually sent out an email message but it also gives you a place to put your answer so you can now click on this and say either consent or objection if you have an objection you need to give a reason for it if you consent you don't need to give a reason for it but you can if you want so I heard them they are great now I could also go and log out and log in as different users and enter some other comments in here I okay I logged out and I logged in as those two users and I I put in comments for them so this is something that they could do if they're you're having an online meeting they could enter in their answers directly into this proposal object if this was a proposal that is being made a big serious proposal and you may want to give it some time for people to consider like a few days then people could come back at any time over those couple of days and maybe you want to consider the answer you know discuss the answer in the following meeting there's a couple different ways you can do it you can see there's a deadline on there that it's due in six days so we put a default deadline of seven days on there but you can change that well in this case everybody consented we had everybody agree on that so that's great what I can do is as the start of this I can close it and basically say okay that resolves it that's the band and we just we just do that there now I've finished the round here but I want to record this in the decision space we've made a decision here so I can create a decision and it's going to copy the text into here now the reason we copy it in but we let you edit it state your decision as clearly as possible often the comments and the proposals are part of the context of a meeting so there's a lot of stuff going on so you understand what's going on people can you simplify the language but a decision is designed to stand on its own so that somebody reading this three months from now can just go and see the decision and understand it so you have to spend a little time to to give it the chance to stand on its own now we created the decision and I'll and I'll show you the list of decision so now it appears in the list of decisions we started on the green tomatoes with abandon and that's all this is is the decision list is a way of bringing these decisions that happen in the middle of this big conversation bringing it out to one place where if somebody was joining the group knew they could see the decisions that were made when they were made and unable to then sort of understand how these are going to guide the behavior of the group going forward okay but let's go back to the meeting and let's say for example in the case of a caterer we don't have such a good proposal we're actually still trying to determine things so you know there's a couple good ideas that people have tossed out there but we need to get a quote and somebody needs to go do that so that's where you bring in the action item idea so on the proposal cater we can say let's go look at the action items and I'm going to create a new action item here so get quote or maybe get three quotes okay and this case we're going to assign this to somebody right somebody needs to go do this so we'll assign this to Alex and I can put some additional details in here I think exactly what you want like I sign a due date if that's if it's the kind of thing I mean we need this urgently so maybe we will set a due date there but we'll create the action item and now it is it is it is now attached and you work your way down to the bottom of the meeting you're now done with the meeting you've handled the meeting you've taken notes all the way through it we can switch this now into complete the meeting so a couple of things happen one is that we have a button here to generate the meet minutes the minutes have not been generated yet that is a separate document but it pulls it from everything that's been done here so let me go ahead and do that I'll click generate the minutes and it'll pull that together and we'll make a separate document for us the minutes appear in draft mode so I can post the minutes without looking at it but that's not a wise thing to do let me click on that and and take a look at it okay so what I like to do is edit this a little bit you know for my minutes I don't I don't really need the do's off and do that I sometimes take out some of this extra things that are here but notice that the opening round the minutes item was added in here the the comment here you get the discussion and how each person responded whether it was consent or object and what their their comments were when you're entering the comments in and you're entering things in during the context of the meeting you sometimes make it sort of sort of simplified what you may want to do here what I often find you have to do is change the language a little bit so that it stands on its own than somebody who wasn't in the meeting would understand it but anyway that's the standard thing that you have to do anyway he got you most of the way to having minutes and depending on how formal your group is you know this this may be enough to do it so I will I'll just save my changes I've changed them I can now post the topic here or I can go back to the meeting itself and I will see here in the meeting that I can post the minutes here and that basically sends an email now to all of the members so now everybody has a email with the minutes in it there's one more thing to do and that is to prepare for the next meeting now you remember we set up everything for the first meeting meaning the second meeting is much easier because what we're going to do is use the clone operation so the clone operation fills in a lot of things for you copy stuff you can you can change the description a little bit you can change the date and time you know whatever but most importantly here you can copy the agenda items across whichever ones you want to for example you already chose the band so you might want to leave that one out for the next meeting but all of those other agenda items still make sense to include those so we will now press clone the meeting and it automatically adds seven days to the meeting maybe that's what you wanted maybe maybe you you know maybe you're not having a weekly meeting maybe it's a different rate so you you know you would go in here and and change it to what the you know maybe you're in a monthly meeting so you pick the date and put it in there pick the time like that and now you're sort of ready to go you've got an agenda ready for the next meeting you're all set up same people argent are assigned you may want to change that you may want to change some of the descriptions and put it back into plan mode and send an email just like you did the first time so you would send an email right now to everybody letting them know that the meeting was coming up and that's it so what I've shown you in this video is running a meeting we started the meeting we recorded the attendees we started taking notes in different ways the opening round we started notes on each of the agenda items we created an action item we did around we made a decision then we completed the meeting we created some minutes and then we cloned the meeting for the next meeting
